                <h3>FLAMINGOES</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p> - Flamingos or flamingoes[a] (/fləˈmɪŋɡoʊz/) are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, which is the only extant family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. 
                    -  There are four flamingo species distributed throughout the Americas (including the Caribbean), and two species native to Afro-Eurasia.
                   
</p>
                <p>
                    - Flamingos usually stand on one leg with the other tucked beneath the body. The reason for this behaviour is not fully understood.
                    - While walking, a flamingo's legs may appear to bend backwards. This appearance is due to the middle joint on their legs being their ankle, not their knee.
                      Flamingos also have webbed feet that aid with swimming and they may stamp their feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom.
                </p>
<p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM?</strong></p>
<p>You will find the Flamingoes at pen E12, next to the first enterence.</p>
