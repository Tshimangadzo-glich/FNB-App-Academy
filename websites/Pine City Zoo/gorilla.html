                <h3>Gorilla</h3>
                <p> The gorilla (Gorilla) is the largest primate and one of our closest relatives, sharing 96–99% of human DNA. 
                    These powerful yet gentle creatures are native to the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.

                    - Species: There are two main species—the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei)—each with subspecies.
                    - Size: Males, known as silverbacks, can weigh up to 270 kg (600 lbs) and stand 1.8 meters (5 ft 11 in) tall.

                </p>
                    - Diet: Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, fruits, and stems
                    - Social Structure: They live in troops led by a dominant silverback, who protects and leads the group.


                <p> </p>
                <p> - Intelligence: Gorillas use tools, communicate through gestures and vocalizations, and display complex emotions.
                    - Conservation: Sadly, gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat destruction, poaching, and disease.

</p>
<p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM?</strong></p>
