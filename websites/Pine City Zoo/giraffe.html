                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p> The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest land animal on Earth, native to Africa. It is known for its long neck, spotted coat, and graceful movements.

                Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.

The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.

Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.


                - Height: Males can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall, while females reach about 4.5 meters (15 feet).

                - Weight: Males weigh around 1,930 kg (4,250 lbs), and females about 1,180 kg (2,600 lbs)

                - Diet: Giraffes are herbivores, feeding mainly on acacia leaves, which they reach using their prehensile tongues (up to 50 cm long).

                - Neck Structure: Despite their long necks, giraffes have only seven vertebrae, just like humans, but each vertebra is elongated </p>

                <p> - Speed: They can run up to 35 mph (56 km/h) for short distances.
                    - Social Life: Giraffes live in loose herds, and males engage in "necking", a form of combat to establish dominance.
                    </p>
                <p> - Conservation: They are classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss and poaching.
</p>
<p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM?</strong></p>
<p>You will find the giraffe at G15,  just beyond the research centre.</p>
