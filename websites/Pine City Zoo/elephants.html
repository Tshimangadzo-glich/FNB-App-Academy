                <h3>Elephants</h3>
                <p>Elephants are fascinating creatures! 
                They are the largest land animals, with three recognized species: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
                - Intelligence & Social Bonds: Elephants are highly intelligent and have strong social connections.
                - They communicate using touch, sight, smell, and sound, including infrasound that travels long distances.
                - Trunks & Tusks: Their trunks have around 150,000 muscle units, making them incredibly versatile for grabbing objects, drinking water, and even greeting each other.
                - Their tusks, which are actually elongated incisor teeth, help them dig, lift objects, and defend themselves.</p>

                <p> - Big Ears & Cooling: Their large ears help regulate body temperature by dissipating heat, especially in hot climates.
                    - Ecosystem Engineers: Elephants play a crucial role in their environment by dispersing seeds and shaping landscapes, benefiting many other species.</p>
                <p> - Conservation Efforts: Many elephant populations are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. 
                    - Conservation projects, like the recent translocation of elephants in South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park, aim to restore ecological balance.
